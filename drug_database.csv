And they werereported in 104 (0.77%) of 13,463 patients who had beenobserved during the 6 years after approval (June 1987 toJune 1993).Adverse reactions to the drug were reported in 317 (1.90%)of 16,703 patients at completion of reexamination. A totalof 456 cases of adverse reactions were reported. The majoradverse reactions were diarrhoea in 54 cases (0.32%), rashin 24 cases (0.14%), anorexia in 19 cases (0.11%), stomachdiscomfort in 19 cases (0.11%), increased ALT (GPT) in81 cases (0.48%), increased AST (GOT) in 70 cases(0.42%), and eosinophilia in 29 cases (0.17%).Adverse reactions with unknown incidence developed afterapproval are also included in the data presented in this section.(1) Clinically significant adverse reactions 1) Shock and anaphylactoid reactions (includingdyspnoea, etc.) (incidence unknown) may develop.The patients should be carefully monitored. If anysigns of shock or anaphylactoid reactions are observed,administration should be discontinued andappropriate therapeutic measures should be taken. 2) Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell syndrome) andMucocutaneous ocular syndrome (Stevens-Johnsonsyndrome) (incidence unknown) maydevelop. The patients should be carefully monitored.If any signs of these syndromes are observed, administrationshould be discontinued and appropriatetherapeutic measures should be taken. 3) Serious nephropathy such as acute renal failure(incidence unknown) may develop. The patientsshould be carefully monitored, and periodic renalfunction tests should be performed. If any abnormalfindings are observed, administration should be discontinuedand appropriate therapeutic measuresshould be taken. 4) Serious colitis with bloody stool such as pseudomembranouscolitis (incidence unknown) maydevelop. If abdominal pain or frequent diarrhoea isobserved, appropriate therapeutic measures, such asimmediate discontinuing administration, should betaken. 5) Hepatic function disorder and jaundice (incidenceunknown) may develop. The patients should be carefullymonitored. If any abnormal findings are observed,administration should be discontinued andappropriate therapeutic measures should be taken. 6) Agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia (incidenceunknown) may develop. The patients should be carefullymonitored. If any abnormal findings are observed,administration should be discontinued andappropriate therapeutic measures should be taken.(2) Clinically significant adverse reactions (similardrugs) 1) Hemolytic anemia has been reported in patientstreated with other cephem antibiotics (cefalotin sodium,cefaloridine, etc.). If any abnormal findings areobserved, appropriate therapeutic measures, such asdiscontinuing administration, should be taken. 2) Interstitial pneumonia and PIE syndrome withfever, cough, dyspnea, chest X-ray abnormalities,and eosinophilia have been reported in patientstreated with other cephem antibiotics. If such symptomsare observed, administration should be discontinuedand appropriate therapeutic measures, such asadministration of adrenocortical hormones, should betaken. ",," PRECAUTIONS 1.Careful Administration (TOMIRON© should be administered with care in the following patients.) (1) Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to penicillin antibiotics [Patients should be interviewed carefully because shock may develop.] (2) Patients who or whose parents or siblings have a predisposition to develop allergic reactions such as bronchial asthma, rash and urticaria. [The patient with allergic predisposition should be carefully interviewed because he/she is more likely to develop hypersensitivity.] (3) Patients with severe renal dysfunction [Persistently elevated blood concentrations may develop. (See _PHARMACOKINETICS_ section.)] (4) Patients with poor oral food intake or who are receiving parenteral alimentation, and patients in poor general health. [Patients who are unable to take vitamin K through food should be observed carefully because vitamin K deficiency may develop. (See _(3) Other adverse reactions_ in _3.
