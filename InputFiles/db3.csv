Digoxin:�Concomitant administration of macrolide antibiotics, including azithromycin, with P-glycoprotein substrates such as digoxin, has been reported to result in increased serum levels of the P-glycoprotein substrate. Therefore, if azithromycin and P-glycoprotein substrates, such as digoxin are administered concomitantly, the possibility of elevated serum digoxin concentrations should be considered.

Ergot:�There is a theoretical possibility of interaction between azithromycin and ergot derivatives (see Precautions).
Zidovudine:�Single 1,000 mg doses and multiple 1,200 mg or 600 mg doses of azithromycin had little effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics or urinary excretion of zidovudine or its glucuronide metabolite. However, administration of azithromycin increased the concentrations of phosphorylated zidovudine, the clinically active metabolite, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear, but it may be of benefit to patients.
Azithromycin does not interact significantly with the hepatic cytochrome P450 system. It is not believed to undergo the pharmacokinetic drug interactions as seen with erythromycin and other macrolides. Hepatic cytochrome P450 induction or inactivation via cytochrome-metabolite complex does not occur with azithromycin.

","Levofloxacin generally has good tolerability. Most adverse effects involve gastrointestinal tract, CNS and skin. Gastrointestinal disturbances constitute the most common adverse reactions. These include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and rarely, pseudomembranous colitis. Most frequent CNS adverse reactions include headache, dizziness, and restlessness. Less commonly, there may be tremors, drowsiness, insomnia, nightmares, visual and other sensory disturbances, and rarely, hallucinations, psychotic reactions, depression, convulsions, paresthesia, and peripheral neuropathy.
Skin reactions are of the hypersensitivity type and include rash and pruritus. Rarely, there have been reports of vasculitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, photosensitivity and anaphylaxis. Like other quinolones, reversible arthralgia and tendon damage have occurred rarely with levofloxacin. Adverse effects of varying frequencies involving other organ systems have been reported with levofloxacin and includes transient increases in serum creatinine or BUN, acute renal failure, crystalluria, elevated liver enzyme values, jaundice, hepatitis, hemolytic anemia and agranulocytosis.

Concurrent use of NSAIDS may increase risk of convulsions.","Haemolytic reactions may occur in G6PD deficiency patients. Exposure to sun or UV-ray may cause photosensitivity reactions. Lowers seizure threshold and predisposes CNS disorder patients to convulsions. Caution in patients with hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or in patients who suffer from rhythm disorders. Increased risk of Achilles tendon or other tendon damage especially in elderly patients, concurrent corticosteroids-receiving patients or organ transplant recipients.
