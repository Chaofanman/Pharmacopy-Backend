And they were reported in 104 (0.77%) of 13,463 patients who had been observed during the 6 years after approval (June 1987 to June 1993). Adverse reactions to the drug were reported in 317 (1.90%) of 16,703 patients at completion of reexamination. A total of 456 cases of adverse reactions were reported. The major adverse reactions were diarrhoea in 54 cases (0.32%), rash in 24 cases (0.14%), anorexia in 19 cases (0.11%), stomach discomfort in 19 cases (0.11%), increased ALT (GPT) in 81 cases (0.48%), increased AST (GOT) in 70 cases (0.42%), and eosinophilia in 29 cases (0.17%). Adverse reactions with unknown incidence developed after approval are also included in the data presented in this section. (1) Clinically significant adverse reactions * 1) Shock and anaphylactoid reactions (including dyspnoea, etc.) (incidence unknown) may develop. The patients should be carefully monitored. If any signs of shock or anaphylactoid reactions are observed  administration should be discontinued and appropriate therapeutic measures should be taken. * 2) Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell syndrome) and Mucocutaneous ocular syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) (incidence unknown) ma develop. The patients should be carefully monitored. If any signs of these syndromes are observed, administration should be discontinued and appropriate therapeutic measures should be taken. *3) Serious nephropathy such as acute renal failure (incidence unknown) may develop. The patients should be carefully monitored, and periodic renal function tests should be performed. If any abnormal findings are observed, administration should be discontinued and appropriate therapeutic measures should be taken. 4) Serious colitis with bloody stool such as pseudomembranous colitis (incidence unknown) may develop. If abdominal pain or frequent diarrhoea is observed, appropriate therapeutic measures, such as immediate discontinuing administration, should be taken. * 5) Hepatic function disorder and jaundice (incidence unknown) may develop. The patients should be carefully monitored. If any abnormal findings are observed, administration should be discontinued and appropriate therapeutic measures should be taken. * 6) Agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia (incidence unknown) may develop. The patients should be carefully monitored. If any abnormal findings are observed, administration should be discontinued and appropriate therapeutic measures should be taken. (2) Clinically significant adverse reactions (similar drugs) * 1) Hemolytic anemia has been reported in patients treated with other cephem antibiotics (cefalotin sodium, cefaloridine, etc.). If any abnormal findings are observed, appropriate therapeutic measures, such as discontinuing administration, should be taken. * 2) Interstitial pneumonia and PIE syndrome with fever, cough, dyspnea, chest X-ray abnormalities, and eosinophilia have been reported in patients treated with other cephem antibiotics.
