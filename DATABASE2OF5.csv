Efficacy decreased with moderate-to-severe baseline renal impairment (ie, CrCl <50 mL/min) for skin and skin structure infections. Administer over at least 1 hr to minimize infusion-related adverse reactions. Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea may occur. May prolong QTc interval; coadministration with other drugs that prolong QTc interval (eg, phenothiazine, TCAs, macrolide antibiotics, class I and III antiarrhythmic agents) increased risk for life-threatening arrhythmias.
